## Advice for new contributors

Start small. The PRs most likely to be merged are the ones that make small, easily reviewed changes with clear and specific intentions.

It's a good idea to gauge interest in your intended work by finding the current issue for it or creating a new one for yourself. Once you've spent a little bit of time planning your solution, it's a good idea to go back to the issue and talk about your approach.
